Back then, I remember that you would only discord with me if Amir were in there. If it is only me, then you would refuse. Until the day Amir called both of us. After we ended the call, you called me right away. I was shy back then, so I didn't know whether to answer you or not, but I decided to answer your call.</p></div>
