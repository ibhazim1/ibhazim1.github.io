            <p>You have become my friend, my confident and the person I can't imagine my life without. I do not know what life would have been if it was not for you.</p>
            <p>I have never felt this way before and it scares me, but I can't imagine not telling you how I fell.</p>
            <p>I know life is full of uncertainties, but one thing I'm certain about is my feeling for you. As days go by, my feelings for you getting stronger.</p>
            <p><span id="didi"></span>, will you give me the opportunity to show you how much you meant to me?</p>
